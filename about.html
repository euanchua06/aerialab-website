                            <h3>Our Story</h3>
                            <p>Founded in 2024 by a group of students at Singapore Polytechnic, AeriaLab was born from a simple observation: Singapore's heavy reliance on food imports presents both a challenge and an opportunity. With the nation's ambitious "30 by 30" goal—to produce 30% of nutritional needs locally by 2030—we recognized the urgent need for innovative solutions to support our local farms.</p>
                            <p>What started as a student project has evolved into a mission to transform how agriculture operates in Singapore and beyond.</p>

                            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Vertical farms across Singapore face mounting pressures. Rising operational costs are squeezing profit margins, making it increasingly difficult for smaller farms to stay competitive. Manual labor costs continue to climb, while the need for skilled and experienced farmers creates a significant barrier to entry and scalability.</p>
                            <p>For many small to medium-sized operations, these challenges threaten their very survival. Traditional monitoring methods are time-intensive, require expert knowledge, and often lack the consistency needed for optimal crop management.</p>

                                <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> Priced to be accessible to smaller farms without compromising on capability</li>
                                <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> No extensive training or agricultural expertise required—intuitive design that anyone can use</li>
                                <li><strong>Accurate:</strong> Computer vision technology powered by YOLO models ensures consistent, reliable plant health assessment</li>
                                <li><strong>Efficient:</strong> Dramatically reduces time spent on manual inspection while improving data quality</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>By combining Intel RealSense depth sensing, NVIDIA Jetson processing power, and our custom plant detection algorithms, we've created a tool that empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions without breaking the bank.</p>
